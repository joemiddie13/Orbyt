# Session Notes — Saturday, February 15, 2026

## Summary
Big session: (1) Premium PhotoDetailPanel, (2) AGPL-3.0 license, (3) Inline sticker reaction menu, (4) Music link cards — full implementation with play-on-card, embedded players, platform differentiation, and creative UI polish.

---

## Premium PhotoDetailPanel (from previous session)
- Replaced browser `prompt()` caption editor with a full glassmorphic detail panel
- Violet theme, ambient orb, polaroid CSS frame, GSAP entrance/exit, parallax on grab
- Owner mode: editable caption textarea + save/delete buttons
- Visitor mode: read-only caption display
- Removed photo emoji + "Photo" header text — let the photo be the star
- Committed as `e0a226e`

---

## AGPL-3.0 License
- Switched from MIT to AGPL-3.0 to protect IP while staying open source
- Confirmed Signal-Server uses AGPL-3.0 as precedent
- Created LICENSE file with official GNU AGPL-3.0 text
- Updated README.md license section with explanation
- Committed as `1ef47ff`

---

## Inline Sticker Reaction Menu
- Dedicated animated emoji button on every canvas object for visitors
- Random-direction slide-out (left/right/up/down) with glass pill bar
- 8 emoji options fan out with staggered bounce, individual hover feedback
- Click → elastic bounce → Convex mutation directly from canvas (no DOM popup)
- Committed as `3d3face`

---

## Music Link Cards (NEW — this session)

### Music Object on Canvas
- Dark rounded card (320x110) with play button | album art | title + artist + platform label
- oEmbed metadata fetching: Spotify, YouTube, YouTube Music, Apple Music
- Platform-colored accent (Spotify green, YouTube red, Apple Music pink)
- Thumbnail loaded via `HTMLImageElement` + `img.decode()` (Convex storage URLs are extensionless)
- Trash can delete icon (top-right, owner only) drawn with PixiJS Graphics

### Play-on-Card
- Tap music card → plays music directly (no popups, no modals)
- Play button toggles to animated equalizer bars (GSAP `repeat: -1, yoyo: true`) with platform-colored glow
- Hidden iframe for YouTube Music (autoplay works silently)
- Visible YouTube video embed floats at bottom-center of screen

### Morph Embeds (Spotify & Apple Music)
- Tap play → PixiJS card hides → official embedded player appears at card's exact position
- Iframe tracks pan/zoom via PixiJS ticker (pauses during drag to avoid fighting)
- Draggable wrapper with grip handle bar — user can reposition the embed
- Drag syncs the underlying PixiJS object position + persists to Convex on release
- Stop playback → embed disappears, card reappears at new position

### Platform Differentiation
- YouTube Music links (`music.youtube.com`) detected separately from regular YouTube
- Separate regex in `validators.ts` (checked before YouTube regex to avoid false match)
- Cards show "YouTube Music" vs "YouTube" labels
- YouTube Music = hidden audio-only, YouTube = visible video embed

### Add Music Modal Polish
- Removed "Add Music" heading — "MUSIC LINK" label + close button on same row
- Official platform SVG icons (Spotify, YouTube, YouTube Music, Apple Music) replace colored dots
- **Breathing glow**: "MUSIC LINK" text-shadow pulses (1.5s sine wave, yoyo infinite)
- **Platform-reactive ambient glow**: preview a link → orb + label + border shift to brand color
- **Flowing gradient border**: conic gradient with `@property --border-angle` rotates around modal (4s loop)
- All three effects shift together when platform is recognized

### Text Size Bump
- Music card: title 15→18, artist 12→14, platform 10→12
- Beacon card: title 18→22 (line-height 24→28), time 14→16, from/location/expired 13→15

### Global Escape Key
- Single `keydown` listener in `+page.svelte` closes topmost open modal/menu
- Handles all modals: inline editor, add music, create beacon, create canvas, photo/beacon/note detail panels, sticker picker, friend code, friends list, canvas switcher
- Also stops music playback if nothing else is open
- SSR-safe: `window.addEventListener` only in `onMount`, guarded `removeEventListener` in `onDestroy`

### CSP Updates
- `frame-src` whitelisted: `open.spotify.com`, `embed.music.apple.com`, `www.youtube.com`

---

## Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/convex/music.ts` | NEW — oEmbed metadata fetching (Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music), `createMusic` mutation |
| `src/convex/validators.ts` | Music URL validation, YouTube Music regex, length constants |
| `src/convex/schema.ts` | Added `music` type to canvasObjects discriminated union |
| `src/lib/canvas/objects/MusicObject.ts` | NEW — dark card with play/eq/glow, thumbnail loading, delete button, drag/tap/long-press |
| `src/lib/canvas/objects/BeaconObject.ts` | Font size bumps (title 22, time 16, secondary 15) |
| `src/lib/canvas/CanvasRenderer.ts` | `setMusicPlaying()`, `getMusicObjectRect()`, `setMusicObjectVisible()`, `moveMusicObject()`, `onMusicDeleted` callback |
| `src/lib/components/AddMusicModal.svelte` | NEW — glassmorphic modal with breathing glow, flowing gradient border, platform-reactive color shift |
| `src/lib/components/MusicDetailPanel.svelte` | NEW (unused) — was original detail panel, replaced by play-on-card approach |
| `src/lib/components/CanvasToolbar.svelte` | Added Music button |
| `src/routes/+page.svelte` | Music playback (morph/hidden/floating), draggable morph wrapper, global Escape handler |
| `src/hooks.server.ts` | CSP: whitelisted Spotify/Apple Music/YouTube iframe sources |

---

## Architecture Decisions
- Play-on-card over floating player — music should feel embedded in the canvas, not pull you out
- Morph embed for Spotify/Apple Music — iframe replaces card visually, tracks pan/zoom, draggable
- Hidden iframe for YouTube Music (autoplay works), visible embed for YouTube (video worth seeing)
- Drag handle needed because cross-origin iframe captures pointer events
- Global Escape handler in `+page.svelte` (not per-component) — single source of truth for modal stack

---

## Session 2 — Bug Fixes, Performance, and Canvas Overlay Styling

### Emoji Reaction Menu Bug Fix
- Menu collapsed before user could select an emoji — `pointerout` fires on parent when cursor moves to child elements (PixiJS event model matches DOM `mouseout`)
- Fixed with debounced collapse: `scheduleCollapse()` (100ms timer) + `cancelCollapse()` on child `pointerover`
- Cursor hops from trigger to emoji options without collapsing

### Convex Query Performance
- `getAccessibleCanvases` warned at 861ms (max 1s) — N friend canvas queries each used `.filter()` post-scan
- Added compound index `by_owner_type` on `["ownerId", "type"]` to canvases table
- Updated friend canvas queries to use compound index — eliminates in-memory filtering

### PhotoDetailPanel Save Button
- "Save Caption" button was hidden until text changed — confusing UX
- Now always visible; dimmed (35% opacity + disabled) when no changes, full violet when modified

### Canvas Overlay Styling (NEW)
- Owner can choose dot matrix or line grid overlay for their canvas
- Persisted per-canvas in Convex (`overlayMode` field on canvases table)
- `updateOverlayMode` mutation (owner-only, auth + RBAC checked)

#### CanvasRenderer Overlay
- `overlayLayer` Container in world (between parchment fill and objects)
- `setOverlayMode()` swaps Graphics children inside the persistent container
- Dots: 2.5px radius circles at 50px grid intervals, `0x9a8570` at 35% alpha
- Lines: 1px strokes at 50px grid intervals, `0x9a8570` at 25% alpha
- 50px margin from canvas edges

#### Canvas Style Picker (`CanvasStylePicker.svelte`)
- Glassmorphic button in bottom-left corner (owner-only)
- Click → popover with 3 SVG icon options (None / Dots / Lines)
- Active option highlighted in warm brown (`#BFA98A`)
- GSAP entrance (scale pop-in) and exit animations
- **Hover preview**: hovering an option temporarily applies the overlay on the canvas
- Cursor leaves popover → reverts to committed mode
- Click → commits to Convex and persists

---

## Files Changed (Session 2)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/convex/schema.ts` | Added `overlayMode` to canvases, `by_owner_type` compound index |
| `src/convex/canvases.ts` | Added `updateOverlayMode` mutation |
| `src/convex/access.ts` | Friend canvas queries use `by_owner_type` compound index |
| `src/lib/canvas/CanvasRenderer.ts` | `overlayLayer` container, `setOverlayMode()`, emoji menu debounce fix |
| `src/lib/components/CanvasStylePicker.svelte` | NEW — bottom-left overlay picker with hover preview |
| `src/lib/components/PhotoDetailPanel.svelte` | Save button always visible (dimmed when no changes) |
| `src/routes/+page.svelte` | Overlay state, picker wiring, `changeOverlayMode()` + preview callback |

---

## Architecture Decisions (Session 2)
- Overlay Container pattern: persistent Container at correct z-position, swap Graphics children inside (avoids PixiJS v8 `Graphics.clear()` quirks)
- Debounced collapse for hover menus: 100ms timer prevents parent→child `pointerout` from closing menus prematurely
- Compound index over post-filter: `by_owner_type` eliminates `.filter()` scan for friend canvas lookups
- Hover preview via separate `onpreview` callback — visual-only, no Convex mutation until click commits

---

## Session 3 — Glassmorphic Toolbar Dropdowns

### Motivation
All toolbar menus (Friends, Friend Code, Canvas Switcher) used to take over the center of the screen as modal overlays with full-screen backdrops. Redesigned them to slide out directly from their toolbar buttons — matching the CanvasStylePicker's glassmorphic energy.

### Design Pattern (from CanvasStylePicker)
Every dropdown follows the same self-contained architecture:
- Owns its trigger button + popover + open/close state
- GSAP entrance: `back.out(2)`, scale 0.6→1, 0.25s
- GSAP exit: `power2.in`, scale 1→0.6, 0.15s
- Click-outside: `document.addEventListener('pointerdown', ...)` in `onMount`
- Escape key: self-handled with `e.stopPropagation()`
- Glassmorphic: `rgba(15, 14, 26, 0.82)`, `backdrop-filter: blur(24px)`

### FriendsList Dropdown
- Modal → self-contained dropdown anchored to people-group icon
- Right-aligned popover (`top-full right-0 mt-2`), transform origin `top right`
- Amber notification dot on trigger when pending friend requests exist
- Compact 288px panel with scrollable content
- Keeps all Convex queries + accept/decline mutations

### CanvasSwitcher Dropdown
- Centered overlay → self-contained dropdown anchored to canvas name button
- Left-aligned popover, transform origin `top left`
- Chevron rotates 180° on open (GSAP animated)
- Canvas list with active amber highlight, emoji icons, role badges
- Select or "New shared canvas" auto-closes dropdown

### FriendCodeModal Dropdown
- Full-screen modal → self-contained dropdown anchored to `+` person icon
- Right-aligned popover, 280px panel
- Monospace friend code display with Copy button
- "Add a friend" input with Enter-to-submit
- Clears status message each time dropdown opens
- Keeps backfill logic for pre-Layer 3 users

### Mutual Exclusion (Free)
Click-outside handlers naturally close one dropdown when another's trigger is clicked — no coordination code needed.

### Architecture Shift
- `+page.svelte` no longer manages modal state for these three components
- Removed `showFriendsList`, `showCanvasSwitcher`, `showFriendCode` state variables
- Removed corresponding imports, template blocks, and Escape handler lines
- Toolbar passes data props instead of callbacks: `activeCanvasId`, `canvases`, `friendCode`
- Each dropdown is fully autonomous — the page doesn't know or care if they're open

## Files Changed (Session 3)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/lib/components/FriendsList.svelte` | Rewrite: modal → self-contained dropdown with trigger, GSAP, click-outside, Escape |
| `src/lib/components/CanvasSwitcher.svelte` | Rewrite: modal → self-contained dropdown with trigger, chevron animation |
| `src/lib/components/FriendCodeModal.svelte` | Rewrite: modal → self-contained dropdown with trigger, compact code/input layout |
| `src/lib/components/CanvasToolbar.svelte` | Embeds all 3 dropdown components, removes callback props, adds data props |
| `src/routes/+page.svelte` | Removes 3 state vars, 3 imports, 3 template blocks, 3 Escape handler lines |

---

## Architecture Decisions (Session 3)
- Self-contained dropdowns over page-managed modals: each component owns its full lifecycle (CanvasStylePicker pattern)
- Data props over callbacks: toolbar receives canvas/friend data and passes it through, rather than firing open/close callbacks
- Escape key handled per-component with `e.stopPropagation()` — prevents global handler from double-firing
- Notification dot on friends trigger — subtle amber indicator when pending requests exist (UX improvement now that list is behind a button)

## Status
- Music link cards: **complete**
- Canvas overlay styling: **complete**
- Glassmorphic toolbar dropdowns: **complete**
- Next: Rive animations + polish, parallax space background, demo prep
