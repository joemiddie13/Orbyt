# Session Notes — Monday, February 17, 2026

## Summary
Shared Orbyt management: settings panel (rename, members, invite, delete), gear icon in switcher, Convex cascade delete. Plus seamless auth reload (no more landing page flash for returning users). Minor rebrand cleanup from prior work.

## OrbytSettingsPanel — Shared Orbyt Management

### Convex Mutations (`src/convex/canvases.ts`)
- **`renameCanvas`**: Owner-only, validates name 1-100 chars, patches canvas name
- **`deleteCanvas`**: Owner-only, shared canvases only (can't delete personal). Full cascade delete:
  1. All `canvasObjects` by `by_canvas` index
  2. Each object's `beaconResponses` (by `by_beacon`) + `stickerReactions` (by `by_object`) in parallel
  3. All `canvasAccess` records (by `by_canvas`)
  4. All `canvasPresence` records (by `by_canvas`)
  5. All `signalingMessages` (by `by_canvas_recipient` prefix query)
  6. The canvas itself
- Photo storage files not explicitly cleaned up (Convex GCs orphaned storage)

### OrbytSettingsPanel.svelte (NEW)
- Glass-panel modal (same pattern as `CreateCanvasModal`)
- **Name section**: editable input + Save button, validates 1-100 chars
- **Members section**: avatar initial, display name, username, role, remove button (owner can remove non-owners)
- **Invite Friends section**: shows friends not already members, checkboxes, bulk invite via `grantAccess` mutation
- **Danger Zone**: red-bordered section, type-to-confirm Orbyt name, delete button calls `deleteCanvas` then `onDeleted()`
- Absorbs all functionality from `CanvasMembersPanel.svelte` (which was never imported anywhere)

### Gear Icon in Canvas Switcher
- Added `onSettings` prop to `CanvasSwitcher` and `onSettingsCanvas` prop to `CanvasToolbar`
- Gear icon (filled SVG cog) visible only on hover of shared Orbyts where `role === 'owner'`
- Uses `<span role="button">` instead of nested `<button>` to avoid SSR hydration mismatch warning
- `e.stopPropagation()` prevents canvas selection when clicking gear
- Subtle styling: white/30 default, white/70 on hover, 22px hit target

### +page.svelte Wiring
- `settingsCanvas` state (`{ id, name } | null`)
- `onSettingsCanvas` callback passed to authenticated `CanvasToolbar`
- `OrbytSettingsPanel` rendered when `settingsCanvas` is set
- `onDeleted` resets to personal canvas and clears `settingsCanvas`
- Added to Escape key priority chain (highest priority, before wellness/inline editor)

### Deleted `CanvasMembersPanel.svelte`
- Confirmed never imported anywhere in codebase
- Fully absorbed by `OrbytSettingsPanel`

## Seamless Auth Reload (No Landing Page Flash)

### Problem
Returning users saw the visitor landing page flash on every reload because the Better Auth token took longer than the 800ms timeout to propagate to Convex.

### Solution: localStorage Hint + Neutral Loading State
- **`orbyt-auth-hint`** flag in localStorage — set on auth success, cleared on logout
- **Returning users** (flag exists): deep space canvas + subtle amber spinning orb (32px, centered, glow pulse). Auth gets 2.5s to propagate. Spinner vanishes instantly when auth arrives.
- **New visitors** (no flag): landing page shows after just 300ms (faster than before)
- **Expired sessions**: spinner shows, auth times out at 2.5s, flag cleared, falls through to landing page

### Security Note
- localStorage flag is purely a UI hint — no auth bypass, no data access based on it
- Real security boundary unchanged: Convex validates auth token server-side before any data
- Even if someone fakes the flag, they'd see a spinner then get bounced to landing

### SSR Fix
- Initial implementation used `typeof localStorage !== 'undefined'` — failed on server because Node's `localStorage` stub exists but lacks `.getItem()`
- Fixed with `typeof window !== 'undefined'` (canonical SvelteKit SSR guard) + `window.localStorage?.getItem()` optional chaining

### Loading Orb CSS (`src/app.css`)
- 32px amber ring spinner with dual animation: `orbSpin` (0.8s linear rotate) + `orbPulse` (2s sine opacity/glow breathe)
- Matches Orbyt amber brand color (`#fbbf24`)

## Pre-existing Changes (from prior work, included in commit)

### Rebrand Cleanup
- `users.ts`: personal canvas name `"'s canvas"` → `"'s Orbyt"`
- `CreateCanvasModal.svelte`: error message `"Give your canvas a name"` → `"Give your Orbyt a name"`
- `CreateBeaconModal.svelte`: visibility toggle `"everyone on canvas"` → `"everyone here"`

### Canvas Switcher Sorting
- `schema.ts`: added `lastAccessedAt` optional field to `canvasAccess` table
- `access.ts`: new `recordCanvasVisit` mutation (updates `lastAccessedAt` on canvas switch)
- `access.ts`: `getAccessibleCanvases` pairs access records with `lastAccessedAt` for switcher sorting

## Architecture Decisions
- Settings panel over per-feature modals: single panel for all Orbyt management (rename, members, invite, delete) — less modal fatigue
- Cascade delete in single mutation: all related records cleaned up atomically in Convex, parallel where possible
- `<span role="button">` for nested clickable: avoids `<button>` inside `<button>` which causes SSR hydration mismatch
- localStorage as UI hint only: never used for auth decisions, only to choose loading screen — security boundary stays server-side
- `typeof window !== 'undefined'` over `typeof localStorage !== 'undefined'`: Node's localStorage stub has the variable but not the methods

---

## Status
- OrbytSettingsPanel: **complete**
- Seamless auth reload: **complete**
- Rebrand cleanup: **complete**
- Next: Convex dashboard issues, Rive animations, deployment
